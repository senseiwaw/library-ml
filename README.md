*Why ?* 
* *the Feynman method*
* *I want do research in AI*
* *feel free to share any recommendations and compare your solutions to mine from the problems in the books*

encyclopedy : 
- "Deep Learning" from I.Goodfellow, Y.Bengio, A.Courville -> considered as an encyclopedy not good to learn from scratch with it
- "Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction" — Kevin Murphy (Vol 1)
