# Library for machine learning learners 
*The goal of this library is to progressively add references for ml learners to help them learn the theoretical foundations of ml faster*

*For that purpose for each book I'll add a personal note explaining the target audience of the book and takeaways from reading the book*

*This library is specially designed for someone who wants to do research in AI in the future.*

*This library can be used to help learners understand research papers faster in order to fill in their knowledge.*
## books : currently reading 
* "Understanding Deep Learning" — Simon J.D. Prince (2023)

encyclopedy : 
- "Deep Learning" from I.Goodfellow, Y.Bengio, A.Courville -> considered as an encyclopedy not good to learn from scratch with it
- "Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction" — Kevin Murphy (Vol 1)
